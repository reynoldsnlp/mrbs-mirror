<a name=authenticate><b>How do I login?</b></a>
<menu>
The system uses LDAP authentication.  This means that you login with the
same username and password as you use for getting email i.e "Mark Belanger"
"MyPassword"

<p>
<a name=meeting_delete><b>Why can't I delete/alter a meeting?</b></a>
<menu>
In order to delete or alter a meeting, you must be logged in as the
same person that made the meeting.  Contact one of the meeting room
administrators or the person who initially made the meeting to
have it deleted or changed.

<p>
<a name=repeating><b>How do I make a recurring meeting?</b></a>
<menu>
Clicking on the desired time brings you into the booking screen.
Select the appropriate <b>Repeat Type</b>.  There is no need
to select a <b>Repeat Day</b> unless you want the meeting to occur
on a different day than the one you initially selected or
you want it to occur on more than one day.
</menu>

<p>
<a name=repeating_delete><b>How do I delete one instance recurring meeting?</b></a>
<menu>
Select the day/room/time that you want to delete and select <b>Delete Entry</b>.
</menu>
<a href=#top>Top</a><hr>
</p>

<p>
<a name=multiple_sites><b>How do I schedule rooms at different sites?</b></a>
<menu>
You don't.  Presently the system cannot book 2 different rooms simultaneously.
You must schedule each one separately.  Make sure that the time you want
is available at both sites before making a booking.
</menu>
<a href=#top>Top</a><hr>
</p>

<p>
<a name=too_many><b>My meeting failed to be created because of "<i>too many entries</i>"!</b></a>
<menu>
Any meeting cannot create more than 365 entries.  There needs to be some limit on the
number of meetings created.  This number can be increased if necessary.
</menu>
<a href=#top>Top</a><hr>
</p>

<p>
<a name=multiple_users><b>What happens if multiple people schedule the same meeting?</b></a>
<menu>
 The short answer is: The first person to click on
the <b>Submit</b> button wins.<br>
Behind the scenes, the system is using a proper mult-user, multi-threaded
relational database than can handle many thousands of simultaneous users.
</menu>

</p>

<p>
<a name=internal_external><b>What is the difference between "Internal" and "External"</b></a>
<menu>
This is of marginal usefulness depending on who you are.  <b>"Internal"</b> means that the
meeting will only be attended by employees.  An <b>"External"</b> meeting might also
be attended by customers, vendors, investors, etc.
</menu>
<a href=#top>Top</a><hr>
</p>

<p>
<a name=different_widths><b>Why are the room columns different widths?</b></a>
<menu>
This is a preference thing.  The system only gives the room column as
much size as it needs.  If nothing is scheduled, or the meeting descriptions
are very short, the column size is minimized so that other rooms will have
more space to display information.
</menu>

</p>

<a name=how_much><b>How much did the system cost?</b></a>
<menu>
Nothing.  See the next section for more information.

<a name=about><b>How does the system work and who wrote it?</b></a>
<menu>
The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=5113">Meeting Room Booking System</a>
is open source software that is distributed under the Gnu Public License(GPL).
This means that software is free to use, distribute, and modify.  
<p>
The system is written mostly in <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a>, 
which is an open source programming language that can be embedded in web 
pages similar in concept to Microsoft active server pages.  PHP is especially 
good at accessing databases.
<p>  
The database used for the system is <a href=http://www.mysql.com>MySQL</a>. 
MySQL is a very fast, multi-threaded, multi-user and robust 
SQL (Structured Query Language) database server that is also GPL.
<p> 
The system will run on multiple platforms. This is running on a
PC architeture using the <a href=http://www.linux.com>Linux</a> operating system.
Linux, is a free, open source, unix-like operating system.
<p>
The web server being used is yet another piece of free, open source
software.  The <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache</a> web server is
the world's most popular web server.
<p>
The bottom line is:<br>
<b>Every piece of this system, from the operating system to the application,
is completely free - source code and all</b>.
