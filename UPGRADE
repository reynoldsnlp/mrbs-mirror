Because this is a beta release, it is un-likely you will be using this for
anything mission critical, I have therefore removed the upgrade code, as
it would no longer work.

There have been no database changes from at least version 0.8, so your
current database should work just fine. although, naturally, you should
back up any data you have before using a new version.
